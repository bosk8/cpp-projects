## Testing All Use Cases

I have set up the test environment with:
1. ✅ Test helper buttons to load CSV files via UI clicks
2. ✅ All 4 sample CSV files available via buttons:
   - sample.csv (16 rows, 4 columns)
   - quoted_fields.csv (quoted fields with commas)
   - empty_rows.csv (rows with empty lines)
   - special_chars.csv (Unicode characters)

**Next Steps**: Execute manual UI testing by:
1. Clicking "Load sample.csv" button
2. Testing all operators manually:
   - Selecting columns from dropdown
   - Selecting operators from dropdown
   - Entering values in input field
   - Clicking Apply button
   - Verifying results
3. Testing all other CSV files
4. Testing error cases
5. Testing export functionality
6. Testing keyboard navigation
